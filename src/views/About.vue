        I'm a Computer Scientist that enjoys the challenges of designing maintainable, extensible, high-performance software. My area of <router-link to="/research">research</router-link> is in classical <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> &mdash; specifically, heuristic search algorithms and the data structures that they use.
        <br/>These algorithms have a wide range of applications: path-planning and action-planning for AI agents in videogames, GPS navigation, alignment of biological sequence data, and many others!
      </div>

      <div style="margin-top: 40px;">Outside of my research, I am particularly interested in <strong>game development</strong> and global illumination techniques, such as <strong>path tracing</strong>. I have worked on several <router-link to="/projects">projects</router-link> related to these topics. Although my current game development experience is limited to <strong>Unity</strong>, I am actively learning to use <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> for some personal projects.</div>

      <!--<div style="margin-top: 40px;">My preferred development language is C++ (ideally C++17 or later), though I also have plenty of experience with C# and Python, as well.</div>-->
